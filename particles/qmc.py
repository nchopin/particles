"""QMC and RQMC sequences.

This module is a simple wrapper for LowDiscrepancy.f, a fortran piece of code
that implements the Sobol' and Halton sequence. (The same fortran code
is used the `randtoolbox
<https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/randtoolbox/index.html>` package
in ``R``.)

To use this module, you must first compile LowDiscrepancy.f, as explained in
the installation notes.

    Parameters

    N : int
        length of sequence
    dim: int
        dimension
    scrambled: int

    Notes
    -----
    One of the argument of the underlying Fortran function is the seed for the
    random generator used for scrambling. We simply generate this seed
    uniformly (between 0 and 2^32 - 1). There is a very small number of seeds
    that generate points that are == 0 (This has been reported to the
    maintainer of randtoolbox). When this happens, we generate a warning and
    start over (i.e.  we re-generate another random seed, and compute a new
    scrambled Sobol point set.
