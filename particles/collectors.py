Collecting summaries at each iteration of a SMC algorithm.

Overview
========

This module implements "summary collectors", that is, objects that collect at
every time t certain summaries of the particle system.  Important applications
are **fixed-lag smoothing** and **on-line smoothing**. However, the idea is a
bit more general that that. Here is a simple example::

    import particles
    # ...
    # define some_fk_model
    # ...
    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=some_fk_model, N=100, moments=True,
                           naive_online_smooth=True)
    my_alg.run()
    print(my_alg.summaries.moments)  # print a list of moments
    print(my_alg.summaries.naive_online_smooth)  # print a list of estimates

Once the algorithm is run, the object `my_alg.summaries` contains the computed
summaries, stored in lists of length T (one component for each iteration t).

Turning off summary collection
==============================

You may set option ``summaries`` of class ``SMC`` to False to avoid collecting
any summary::

    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=some_fk_model, N=100, summaries=False)

This might be useful in cases when you need to keep a large number of SMC
objects in memory (as in SMC^2). In that case, even the default summaries (see
below) might take too much space.

Default summaries
=================

By default, the following summaries are collected:
    * ``ESSs``: ESS at each iteration;
    * ``rs_flags``: whether resampling was triggered or not at each time t;
    * ``logLts``: log-likelihood estimates.

Computing moments
=================

To compute moments (weighted averages, or other functions of the particle
sample), use option ``moments`` as follows::

    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=some_fk_model, N=100, moments=mom_func)

where ``mom_func`` is a function with the following signature::

    def mom_func(W, X):
        return np.average(X, weights=W)

If option ``moments`` is set to ``True``, the default moments  are computed.
For instance, for a ``FeynmanKac`` object  derived from a state-space model,
the default moments at time t consist of a dictionary, with keys 'mean', and
'var', containing the particle estimates (at time t) of the filtering mean
and variance.

It is possible to define different defaults for the moments. To do so,
override method `default_moments` of the considered FeynmanKac class::

    class Bootstrap_with_better_moments(Bootstrap):
        def summary(W, X):
            return np.average(X**2, weights=W)
    # ...
    # define state-space model my_ssm
    # ...
    my_fk_model = Bootstrap_with_better_moments(ssm=my_ssm, data=data)
    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=my_fk_model, N=100, moments=True)

In that case, ``my_fk_model.summaries.moments`` is a list of weighed averages
of the squares of the components of the particles.


Fixed-lag smoothing
===================

Fixed-lag smoothing means smoothing of the latest h states; that is, computing
(at every time t) expectations of

.. math::
    \mathbb{E}[\phi_t(X_{t-h:t}) | Y_{0:t} = y_{0:t}]

for a fixed integer $h$ (at times $t \geq h$; if $t<h$, replace $h$ by $t$).

This requires keeping track of the $h$ previous states for each particle;
this is achieved by using a rolling window history, by setting option
``store_history`` to an int equals to $h+1$ (the length of the trajectories)::

    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=some_fk_model, N=100, fixed_lag_smooth=phi,
                           store_history=3)  # h = 2

See module `smoothing` for more details on rolling window and other types of
particle history. Function phi must have the same signature as for moments::

    def phi(W, X):
        return np.average(np.array(X), axis=-1, weights=W)

Note however that X is a deque of length at most $h$; it behaves like a list,
except that its length is always at most $h + 1$.  Of course this function
could simply return its arguments ``W`` and ``X``; in that case you simply
record the fixed-lag trajectories (and their weights) at every time $t$.

On-line smoothing
=================

On-line smoothing is the task of approximating, at every time t,
expectations of the form:

.. math::
    \mathbb{E}[\phi_t(X_{0:t}) | Y_{0:t} = y_{0:t}]

On-line smoothing is covered in Sections 11.1 and 11.3 in the book. Note that
on-line smoothing is typically restricted to *additive* functions $\phi$, see below.

The following three algorithms are implemented:

* ``naive_online_smooth``: basic forward smoothing (carry forward full trajectories);
  cost is O(N) but performance may be poor for large t.
* ``ON2_online_smooth``: O(N^2) on-line smoothing. Expensive (cost is O(N^2),
  so big increase of CPU time), but better performance.
* ``'paris'``: on-line smoothing using Paris algorithm. (Warning: current
  implementation is very slow, work in progress).

These algorithms compute the smoothing expectation of a certain additive
function, that is a function of the form:

.. math::
    \phi_t(x_{0:t}) = \psi_0(x_0) + \psi_1(x_0, x_1) + ... + \psi_t(x_{t-1}, x_t)

The elementary function :math:`\psi_t` is specified by defining method
`add_func` in considered state-space model. Here is an example::

    class ToySSM(StateSpaceModel):
        def PX0(self):
            ... # as usual, see module `state_space_model`
        def add_func(self, t, xp, x):  # xp means x_{t-1} (p=past)
            if t == 0:
                return x**2
            else:
                return (xp - x)**2

The reason why additive functions are specified in this way is that
additive functions often depend on fixed parameters of the state-space model
(which are available in the closure of the ``StateSpaceModel`` object, but
not outside).

The two first algorithms do not require any parameter::

    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=some_fk_model, N=100, naive_online_smooth=True)

Paris algoritm has an optional parameter ``Nparis``, which you may specify
as follows::

    my_alg = particles.SMC(fk=some_fk_model, N=100, paris=5)

If option `paris` is set to True, then the default value (2) is used.

User-defined collectors
=======================

You may implement your own collectors as follows::

    import collectors

    class ToyCollector(collectors.Collector):
        summary_name = 'toy'
        def fetch(self, smc):  # smc is the particles.SMC instance
            return smc.X[self.arg]
            # self.arg is the argument passed to the collector

Once this is done, you may use this new collector exactly as the other
ones::

    pf = particles.SMC(N=30, fk=some_fk_model, toy=3)

Then ``pf.summaries.toy`` will be a list of the summaries collected at each
time by the ``fetch`` method.
