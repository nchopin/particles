Python 2 vs Python 3 
====================

Short version: **particles** only supports Python 3.

Long version:  initially, **particles** supported both Python 2 and Python 3.
However, Python 2 has been deprecated, and supporting it has become
troublesome. The last version to support it has been turned into a release; you
may find in the releases section of the github page (first release, April 15,
2020). 


Requirements
============

The short version: install The Anaconda_ distribution 
to get all the scientific computing libraries you may ever need in one go. 

.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution 

The long version: **particles** requires the following libraries: 

* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ 
* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ 
* `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_
* `joblib <https://joblib.readthedocs.io/>`_
* `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org>`_ (only for module `binary_smc`)

In addition, it is **strongly recommended** to install the following 
libraries (optional ``[extra]`` dependencies):

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_
* `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_
* `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_
* `statsmodels <https://www.statsmodels.org/>`_

Most of the scripts require the first two libraries to plot the results; a few
of them also requires `pandas` or `statsmodels`.

Again, the easiest way to install all these libraries in one go is to simply
install the Anaconda_ distribution.  Manual installation is of course also
possible; e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian:: 

    sudo apt install python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-numba python3-joblib python3-sklearn

However, in the maintainer's experience, conda is usually less hassle,  
runs faster (because it install a more efficient version of low-level libraries
such as BLAS) and provides more recent versions.

Installation: recommended method
================================

The package is available on Github_ and may be installed using git::

    cd some_folder_of_your_choosing
    git clone https://github.com/nchopin/particles.git
    cd particles
    pip install -e .[extra]

The option `-e` installs the package in editable mode (any modification you
make in this folder will be taken into account when you import the package).
Replace `-e` by `--user` if you want to avoid that. Also, you may need to
replace the last line by::

    pip install -e '.[extra]'

on certain shells (e.g. zsh).

Installation: alternative method
================================

The package is also available on PyPI_ (the Python package index), so you may
install it by running pip. On a Linux machine:: 

    pip install --user particles[extra]

.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi 

Option ``--user`` lets you install the package in your home directory, rather than
globally for all users. 

The main drawback of this method is that it installs only the modules of the
package, and not the scripts found in folders book and papers.
