Python 2 vs Python 3 
====================

**particles** is currently compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3. When 
Python 2 gets deprecated (around 2020) Python 2 support may be dropped. 

Requirements
============

The short version: install The Anaconda_ distribution 
to get all the scientific computing libraries you may ever need in one go. 

.. _Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/distribution 

The long version: **particles** requires the following libraries: 

* `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ 
* `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_ 
* `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_

In addition, it is **strongly recommended** to install the following plotting
libraries:  

* `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_,
* `seaborn <https://seaborn.pydata.org/>`_

Most of the examples require these libraries to plot results. 

Again, the easiest way to install all these libraries in one go is to simply
install the Anaconda_ distribution.  Manual installation is of course also
possible; e.g. on Ubuntu/Debian:: 

    sudo apt install python-numpy python-scipy python-numba python-matplotlib python-seaborn

However, in the maintainer's experience, conda is usually less hassle, and 
runs faster (because it install a more efficient version of low-level libraries
such as BLAS). 

Basic installation
==================

The package is available on PyPI_ (the Python package index), so you may
install it by running pip. On a Linux machine:: 

    pip install --user particles

It is best to install any package from PyPI_ **without** root privilege.
Option ``--user`` lets you install the package in your home directory, rather than
globally for all users. 

.. _PyPi: https://pypi.python.org/pypi 

Manual/Editable installation
============================

The package is available on Github_ and may be installed using git::

    cd some_folder_of_your_choosing
    git clone https://github.com/nchopin/particles.git
    pip install -e --user . 

Option -e installs the package in editable mode: i.e. it keeps 
files in the folder you chose, and you may edit any file directly. 

.. _Github: https://github.com/nchopin/particles.git

Troubleshooting
===============

If the two methods above fail, you may try this::

    cd some_folder_of_your_choosing
    git clone https://github.com/nchopin/particles.git
    python setup.py --force 

This will install the package, without compiling the little bit of Fortran code 
that is used in module `qmc`. At this stage, you may already use the package if
you do not use anything related to quasi-Monte Carlo (i.e. option ``qmc`` in
class `SMC`). In addition, you may compile manually the said piece of Fortran 
as follows:: 

    pip show particles  # tells you the folder where the package is installed
    cd where_particles_is_installed/particles 
    f2py -c ../src/LowDiscrepancy.f -m lowdiscrepancy

(Utility `f2py` is part of Numpy; see here_.)
